    <h1>Re-Imagining Cryptography and Privacy (ReCAP) Workshop</h1>        
        <br>
        <p>
          The Re-Imagining Cryptography and Privacy (ReCAP) Workshop explores the ways in which cryptography and privacy intersect with society toward designing, creating, and sustaining technologies that explicitly benefit marginalized communities. We welcome work and perspectives from social scientists, humanities scholars, community organizations, and technologists. The focus of the ReCAP Workshop is Re-Imagination: identifying the aspects of cryptography and privacy technology production that contribute to marginalization, and solidifying approaches, ideas, and designs that center marginalized voices, resist toxic aspects of technology production and work toward dismantling systems of marginalization. The ReCAP Workshop seeks to build and sustain a diverse community that is committed to the broadening of access to the field and engaging in socially-conscious work. 

        </p>

        <p>ReCAP 2025 is a <strong>hybrid workshop from June 3-4, 2025</strong> that will take place physically in <strong>New York, New York (USA)</strong> and virtually on <strong>Zoom</strong>.</p>

      <!-- <h3 id="recap24">ReCAP 2024</h3>
	<p>ReCAP 2024 is a <strong>hybrid workshop</strong> from <strong>May 
2-3, 2024</strong> that will take place physically at <strong>Tufts University</strong> in Medford, 
Massachusetts (USA) 
and virtually on <strong>Zoom</strong>. The workshop itself is <strong>free</strong> but we unfortunately we do not have travel stipends available for 
physical attendance this year and hope to secure funding in the future.</p>


<h3 id="reg">Registration</h3>
<p>The workshop is open to all who register. To register, please fill out <a

        <h3 id="announcements">Call for Submissions</h3> 

        Submissions to ReCAP 2025 will be accepted on a rolling basis until <strong>April 10, 2025</strong>. All submissions that fit the workshop topic(s) will be included in the workshop proceedings (published on the ReCAP website and as a printable zine), and as many submissions as possible will be included in the workshop program (depending on desired presentation format and volume of submissions per topic). To submit an idea, <strong>please use <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/3/form/view/f0ad5dbc0beb1686c79b18d9bb13b3bc/">this link</a>.</strong>

</br></br>
        <p>We are looking for submissions related to the following topics. We offer some guiding questions as points of reflection and discussion but your submission need not answer each one:</p>



        <strong>Community Voices:</strong> This session creates space for people working from within community organizations or for individuals with marginalized intersections of identity to share their experiences with harms relating to privacy or surveillance. Additionally, we hope for this to be an opportunity to drive further community engagement and relationship building. We will prioritize those outside of academia to share their perspectives in this session.

        <ul>
          <li>
            In what ways does this submission center first-hand and/or community experiences on privacy or surveillance?
            <!-- Is this submission about first-hand and/or community experiences at the intersection of privacy or surveillance and marginalized identity? -->
          </li>
          <li>
            Is this submission a call to action/call for movement-building?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does this submission highlight an overlooked dimension of experiencing or resisting privacy harms?
          </li>
        </ul>

      </br>

      <strong>Privacy and Systems of Power:</strong> Systems of power, while amplified by certain technologies, exist beyond a singular realm of study and cannot be deconstructed or re-imagined only along a single axis.
		This session serves as a space for understanding the realities of communities who resist systems of power, and for resistance mechanisms that center the expertise of marginalized communities over technical solutions.      
This session serves as a space to understand the privacy needs of people and communities that centers lived experiences over technical solutions. 
	We invite perspectives from different academic subdisciplines in this session, including (but not limited to) work that combats institutionalized 
surveillance.
       <!-- Work in this session might include discussion of surveillance systems and privacy needs encountered -->
      <!-- : the surveillance systems of police, local law enforcement, and domestic federal agencies such as the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), intimate partner, family, and peer surveillance, and the surveillance technologies deployed in school, healthcare, and welfare systems.  -->
      <ul>
        <li>Does this highlight a particular perspective or experience with marginalization, surveillance, or resistance?</li>
        <li>
          Does this work apply a critical lens to systems of power or to a practice within the privacy community?</li>
          <li>Does this work explore the impact of social infrastructures (legal systems, NGOs, etc) on marginalization, particularly within the realm of privacy or surveillance?</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Privacy Applications & Infrastructure:</strong> How do we think about, talk about, design, build, and sustain cryptography and privacy tools that meet the needs of individuals and groups of people? How might existing practices of threat modeling, protocol design, and deployment in cryptography and privacy flatten, miss, or undermine people's needs? 

      <ul>
        <li>Does this submission highlight a limitation or provide a critique of an existing model, technique, or tool in meeting the needs of marginalized communities?</li>
        <li>
          How does this submission illustrate the challenges and best practices for carrying out this type of work?
        </li>

        <li>If the proposed model, protocol, or tool is intended to support a particular group's needs, how was this group involved in development of the proposed solution?</li>

    <h3>Informal Discussion Sessions</h3>
    
  ReCAP 2025 will feature two informal spaces for discussion. Participation does not require any formal submission. More information will be made available to attendees closer to the workshop.
      <!-- This session will consider the lived privacy needs and practices of marginalized people, as well as mechanisms for co-creating cryptography and privacy tools that reflect these needs and practices. -->

        <!-- Open Problems & Emerging Work: This session is a space to share perspectives on privacy issues that marginalized people face, across disciplines and both inside and outside of academia. It is also a space to discuss and gather input from ReCAP attendees on new problems or ongoing work. We do not require formal submissions for this session and mainly want to indicate that this space will be available at ReCAP.  -->
        
  </br> </br>
        <p><strong>Open Problems & Emerging Work:</strong> This session is a space discuss and gather input from ReCAP attendees on new problems or ongoing work. This session will be structured as a series of lightning talks followed by group discussions.
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is there a question or problem you would like to discussion with ReCAP attendees?
          
          </li>

          <li>  Are you looking for potential collaborations, especially outside your area of expertise?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
        
      
            <!-- Examples: -->

                <!-- https://recapworkshop.online/recap24/contributions/holmes-quiet-slackier-signal.html -->
            <!-- Structure: -->
                <!-- Sequence of Lightning Talks (timing TBD) -->
                <!-- Four 15-minute, informal small-group discussion chunks following talks -->
                <!-- Submit title and short blurb, up to two weeks before ReCAP -->



      </br>
      <strong>Reflection and Discussion:</strong> This will be an informally moderated space in which to reflect, share experiences and anecdotes, pose problems, and look toward solutions. Through this conversation we hope to inform the visioning of future iterations of ReCAP, and think toward what we are all looking for in a space that re-imagines cryptography and privacy in ways that are meaningful to the ReCAP community. This session will not be recorded, though participants will be free to document ideas (with the ideators' consent) on sticky notes or the blackboard. 
      <!-- We do not require formal submissions for this session and mainly want to indicate that this space will be available at ReCAP. -->
