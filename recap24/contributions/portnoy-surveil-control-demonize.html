	<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
	<p>A new Texas social media bill promises “protection of minors,” while 
Mississippi lawmakers are taking aim at “material harmful to minors.” One bill in 
Congress, meanwhile, promises “kids online safety,” while another wants to “protect 
children suffering from abuse.” Despite the names, these bills will lead to censoring 
large parts of the internet, including LGBTQ+ content and information about gender 
identity, abortion, and trans support. They will be used to justify email surveillance and 
online speech filtering. This talk will highlight some of these bad bills, and explain how 
these measures are part of the same siege that is already depriving women, LGBTQ+ people, 
young people, and other vulnerable groups of their fundamental rights to free speech, 
expression, and assembly, to name a few. We’ll discuss how these efforts are part of a 
bigger trend of attacks perpetrated by lawmakers and organized groups with political 
agendas and power that seek to control and silence the less powerful, highlighting some of 
the very real consequences that we’ve already seen. We’ll conclude by touching on how 
cryptographers and scholars can help halt this horrifying trend.</p>
