        Submissions to ReCAP 2025 will be accepted on a rolling basis until <strong>April 10, 2025</strong>. As many submissions as possible will be included in the workshop program (depending on desired presentation format and volume of submissions per topic). All submissions that fit the workshop topic(s) will (optionally) have their title, author list, and abstract published on the ReCAP website. The title and author list will (optionally) be included in the printable zine. To submit an idea, <strong>please use <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/ZJwhIVz0Ml-TlvKHb5y2Ze2vv7Ff+Nlb-J6GSUG3K7I/">this link</a>.</strong>

        <p>We are looking for submissions related to the following topics. We offer some guiding questions as points of reflection and discussion but <strong>your submission need not answer each one:</strong></p>



        <strong>Community Voices:</strong> This session creates space for people working from within community organizations or for individuals with marginalized intersections of identity to share their experiences with harms relating to privacy or surveillance. Additionally, we hope for this to be an opportunity to drive further community engagement and relationship building. We will prioritize those outside of academia to share their perspectives in this session.

        <ul>
          <li>
            In what ways does this submission center first-hand and/or community experiences on privacy or surveillance?
            <!-- Is this submission about first-hand and/or community experiences at the intersection of privacy or surveillance and marginalized identity? -->
          </li>
          <li>
            Is this submission a call to action/call for movement-building?
          </li>
          <li>
            Does this submission highlight an overlooked dimension of experiencing or resisting privacy harms?

      <strong>Privacy and Systems of Power:</strong> Systems of power, while amplified by certain technologies, exist beyond a singular realm of study and cannot be deconstructed or re-imagined only along a single axis.
		This session serves as a space for understanding the realities of communities who resist systems of power, and for resistance mechanisms that center the expertise of marginalized communities over technical solutions.      
This session serves as a space to understand the privacy needs of people and communities that centers lived experiences over technical solutions. 
	We invite perspectives from different academic subdisciplines in this session, including (but not limited to) work that combats institutionalized 
surveillance.
       <!-- Work in this session might include discussion of surveillance systems and privacy needs encountered -->
      <!-- : the surveillance systems of police, local law enforcement, and domestic federal agencies such as the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), intimate partner, family, and peer surveillance, and the surveillance technologies deployed in school, healthcare, and welfare systems.  -->
      <ul>
        <li>Does this highlight a particular perspective or experience with marginalization, surveillance, or resistance?</li>
        <li>
          Does this work apply a critical lens to systems of power or to a practice within the privacy community?</li>
          <li>Does this work explore the impact of social infrastructures (legal systems, NGOs, etc) on marginalization, particularly within the realm of privacy or surveillance?</li>

      <strong>Privacy Applications & Infrastructure:</strong> How do we think about, talk about, design, build, and sustain cryptography and privacy tools that meet the needs of individuals and groups of people? How might existing practices of threat modeling, protocol design, and deployment in cryptography and privacy flatten, miss, or undermine people's needs? 

      <ul>
        <li>Does this submission highlight a limitation or provide a critique of an existing model, technique, or tool in meeting the needs of marginalized communities?</li>
        <li>
          How does this submission illustrate the challenges and best practices for carrying out this type of work?
        </li>

        <li>If the proposed model, protocol, or tool is intended to support a particular group's needs, how was this group involved in development of the proposed solution?</li>

    <strong>Creative Expression:</strong> This session will be dedicated to all forms of creative expression (multi-media art, music, song, dance, poetry and creative writing, performance, etc.) produced and enjoyed by people in the cryptography and privacy community. The creative expression itself does not need to relate to cryptography or privacy.
